As I get ready to head to the U.S. for my master's in computer science, it's time to buckle down 
and start prepping for those dreaded technical interviews-especially with the current tech winter looming.

To stay ahead of the game, I've put together a topic-wise problem list on LeetCode to
tackle interview questions one step at a time. Along the way, I'll also be writing detailed solutions
and explanations for **some of** the problems I solve. Not only will this help me really understand the concepts,
but it's also a great way to build my problem-solving memory bank.

>Oh, and bonus: it's also the perfect chance to practice my English writing and get better
>at explaining things clearly. Let's see where this journey takes me!
